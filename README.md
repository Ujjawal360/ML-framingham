# ML-framingham

The data set is publicly available on the Kaggle website(https://www.kaggle.com/dileep070/logistic-regression/data?select=framingham.csv), and it is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD). The data set provides the patientsâ€™ information. It includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes. Each attribute is a potential risk factor. There are both demographic, behavioral and medical risk factors.

Five different ML models are used to predict CHDs. Read my article at: https://medium.com/@ujjawalshah1080/machine-learning-models-to-predict-coronary-heart-disease-aka-heart-attack-chds-5777d3a90253
